                INTUTION is a game of games, players must beat 9 different stages of UI-based memory and puzzle games with increasing difficulty to win.

                This is my first original game made outside of class. Its made entirely in Geometry Dash and it showcases my skills in programming, optimization, game design, and UI design. 
                However, in a lot of respects this game taught me what not to do, and I have changed how I approach game development because of that.
                As for optimization, developing this project also taught me the importance of tackling performance issues and figuring out how to approach finding causes for issues that playtesters encountered.
