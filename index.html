            <p1>INTUITION is a game of games, players must beat 9 different stages of UI-based memory and puzzle games with increasing difficulty to win.</p1>
            <p>
                This is my first original game made outside of class. Its made entirely in Geometry Dash and it showcases my skills in programming, optimization, game design, and UI design. 
                However, in a lot of respects this game taught me what not to do, and I have changed how I approach game development because of that.
                As for optimization, developing this project also taught me the importance of tackling performance issues and figuring out how to approach finding causes for issues that playtesters encountered.

            <p1>EZ Typing is a short typing game with two twists: you type by clicking keys on the UI keyboard, and you control your cursor like the ship from Asteroids</p1>

            <p>
                This game was made for my final project in MI 230: Game Design. The project allowed for complete freedom so I decided to go with an idea I had for a while. My main goal in the game design itself
                was to make it as annoying as possible while also making the gameplay fun to learn.
                I didn't know much about scripting in Unity so I learned a lot in that regard through making this project.

            <p1>Placed into a randomized island, you have 10 minutes to level up and find a good weapon before the final boss arrives</p1>
            
            <p>
                Lacertus is my biggest game project and my second game made in Geometry dash. Its a rogue-like rpg game with souls-like inspiration. Even though its not quite done yet, even in its current state it showcases my skills
                in game design, level design, combat design, animation, UI, and much more. I've certainly learned a ton throughout working on this project especially with handling the large tasks that this game entails.
                I've had to pace myself with every aspect of production and have found it a very gruelling process. Its on track to realease early March and I'm excited to finally be done with it!
